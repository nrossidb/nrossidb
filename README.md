I'm a huge nerd with a passion for data, stats, and all things numbers.

I am an aspiring Data Scientist who recently made the decision to leave my career in entrepreneurship and finance to pursue Data Science full time. My self-starter attitude and analytical background has lead me to the wonderful worlds of Python and SQL.
